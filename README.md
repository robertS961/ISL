Hello Visitors!

I did some digging on the web and heard that the best way to learn Machine Learning and AI was to understand the stats and math behind it.

I was recommended "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" from several scources online. So here I am working through the book.

I will post my answers to the applied, labs,  and sometimes the conceptual questions as I work through the book.

I hope it can benefit others working through the book or just wanting to challenge themselves!

Cheers,

Robert
