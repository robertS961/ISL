Alternatively, one could compute those quantities using just sm.GLM() and the predict() method of the ftted model within a for loop. You will now take this approach in order to compute the LOOCV error for a simple logistic regression model on the Weekly data set. Recall that in the context of classifcation problems, the LOOCV error is given in (5.4)."

There wasn't a train test split. So both data utilized around the maximum training data. If we performed another Logistic Regression with a 50/50 trian test split then I believe we would see different results. These new results would have been trained on half the data so they would exhibit higher bias, but lower variance.\n",
