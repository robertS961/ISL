We consider the simple case where p = 1; i.e. there is only one feature. Suppose that we have K classes, and that if an observation belongs to the kth class then X comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution, X ∼ N(µk, σ2 k). Recall that the density function for the one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.16). Prove that in this case, the Bayes classifer is not linear. Argue that it is in fact quadratic."

Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10 % of the range of X closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with X = 0.6, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65].
